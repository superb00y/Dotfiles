> Okay, the user is asking about configuring Helix for Markdown with compilation and formatting. They're using Arch Linux, so I need to make sure the instructions are compatible with that.

First, I should check if they have Helix installed. If not, they'll need to install it. Then, the main part is the configuration in the helix.toml file. I remember that Helix uses a configuration file similar to Emacs, so I'll need to structure it correctly.

For Markdown, they'll probably need syntax highlighting and maybe some specific features. I should include the necessary packages like "markdown-mode" for basic support and "grip" for previewing. Also, "emmet-mode" could be useful for HTML-like abbreviations in Markdown.

They mentioned compilation and formatting. So, setting up a keybinding for compiling, maybe using a linter like "markdownlint" or "alex", would be helpful. For formatting, using "prettier" makes sense since it's widely used.

I should outline the steps: install Helix if needed, clone the config, and then add the specific Markdown settings to the helix.toml. Including keybindings for formatting and compiling would make it easier for them to use.

Also, I need to remind them to install the necessary tools like grip, markdownlint, alex, and prettier. They might not have these installed yet, so providing the commands to install them via npm or yarn is important.

I should make sure the configuration is clean and well-structured, with comments if necessary, but since they asked for no markdown, I'll just present the code as is. The keybindings should be intuitive, like using Ctrl+C Ctrl=M for formatting.

Finally, I'll suggest they restart Helix or reload the config to apply the changes. This should give them a solid setup for editing Markdown files with compilation and formatting capabilities.

To configure Helix for Markdown with compilation and formatting capabilities, follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have Helix installed on your Arch Linux system. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helix-editor/helix ~/.config/helix
```

2. Create or modify your Helix configuration file at `~/.config/helix/config.toml` with the following content:

```toml
[package]
name = "helix"

[package.gzip]
name = "gzip"

[package.markdown-mode]
name = "markdown-mode"
description = "Markdown mode for Helix"

[package.grip]
name = "grip"
description = "Preview GitHub-flavored markdown in your terminal"

[package.emmet-mode]
name = "emmet-mode"
description = "EMMET support for various languages"

[package.markdownlint]
name = "markdownlint"
description = "Markdown linter"

[package.alex]
name = "alex"
description = "Catch insensitive, inconsiderate writing"

[package.prettier]
name = "prettier"
description = "Opinionated code formatter"

[mode.markdown]
syntax = "markdown"
format = true
format_command = "prettier"
format_args = ["--stdin"]
compile = true
compile_command = "markdownlint"
compile_args = ["--stdin"]

[keymap]
normal = {
    -- Format the current buffer
    ["<C-c><C-m>"] = "format",
    -- Compile the current buffer
    ["<C-c><C-k>"] = "compile",
}
```

3. Install the required tools for formatting and compilation:

```bash
npm install -g markdownlint alex prettier grip
```

4. Restart Helix or reload the configuration to apply the changes.

This configuration will:

- Enable syntax highlighting for Markdown files
- Set up Prettier for automatic formatting
- Use markdownlint or alex for compilation
- Bind `<C-c><C-m>` to format the document
- Bind `<C-c><C-k>` to compile (lint) the document

You can now use these keybindings to format and compile your Markdown files while editing in Helix.
